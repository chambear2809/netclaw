/// 105/US1/FR-001/FR-002: shown before `EnrollmentScreen`'s QR scanner on
/// every launch where nothing is enrolled yet (an "unenrolled-state" screen,
/// not a "seen once, never again" one — see spec.md's edge cases). Never
/// shown once a valid enrollment is persisted. Makes no camera, network, or
/// permission calls of its own — purely explanatory copy plus one action.
///
/// Also carries the AI-data-sharing disclosure required before any question
/// or capture is ever sent (App Review Guidelines 5.1.1(i)/5.1.2(i)): the
/// operator's Border forwards typed/spoken questions, and any photo/video/
/// audio the operator chooses to send, to whichever AI model the Border
/// operator chose at setup -- entirely the operator's own decision, made at
/// installation time, and NOT something NetClaw itself enforces, defaults,
/// or controls. That may be a third-party provider (e.g. this project's own
/// reference config/openclaw.json happens to reference Anthropic, but that
/// is only this repo's own example configuration, not a requirement) or a
/// locally-run, fully offline/private model with no third-party data
/// sharing at all. Requiring the checkbox below before the primary action
/// is enabled is this app's one point of explicit, affirmative consent,
/// since it is the one screen every device sees exactly once, before any
/// data-sending feature becomes reachable.
