# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw Mobile Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center Widgets (B1b+B2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The deployment-target question (whether to drop pre-iOS-18
  support for the new widget target) was resolved directly by the operator before this spec was written
  ("drop old version support, this is for modern device OSs"), recorded in Assumptions rather than left as
  a marker.
- Mentions of specific files/classes (`HeartbeatStatusStore.swift`, `WatchDataStore.swift`,
  `DeviceHeartbeatStore`, `PendingApprovalActivityAttributes`) appear only in Context and Assumptions,
  matching this repo's established pattern — they record verified, code-level evidence (including three
  real target-setup defects found and fixed via a real `xcodebuild` run before this spec was written, not
  assumed correct from the operator's own Xcode wizard output) that grounds this spec's design.
- This spec explicitly documents that the new target needed real fixes (wrong embedding, wrong bundle id,
  wrong App Group, missing iOS 18 floor) as background in Context, since those fixes happened in this
  branch's own setup commit before Phase 0 research began — not something this spec's own tasks re-do.
