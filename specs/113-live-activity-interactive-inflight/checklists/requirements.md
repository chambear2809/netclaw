# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw Mobile Interactive and In-Flight Live Activity (B3)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The one genuinely open question this spec depended on —
  whether the brief's `respondedMembers`/`expectedMembers` design was buildable as specified — was resolved
  by dedicated research against the actual Border delegation code (`gateway.py`, `service.py`, `router.py`)
  and a real captured trace (`MAC-IOS-HANDOFF.md`) BEFORE writing this spec, rather than left as a marker or
  assumed true from the brief's prose. The finding (a phone-submitted ask is one sequential agent turn
  discovering delegated members one at a time, never a fanned-out N-parallel request with a known count)
  directly narrowed FR-006, and is recorded in full in Context rather than silently guessed around.
- Mentions of specific files/APIs (`PendingApprovalActivityAttributes.swift`, `LiveActivityBridge.swift`,
  `ConversationStore.onCompleted`, `gateway.py`'s `run_agent_turn`, `netclaw://` scheme) appear only in
  Context and Assumptions, matching this repo's established pattern (see specs 105/110/111/112's own
  checklist notes for the same convention) — they exist to record verified, code-level evidence, including
  one direct correction to the source brief's own assumption, that grounds this spec's design. User
  Scenarios, Functional Requirements, and Success Criteria stay implementation-agnostic throughout.
- This spec deliberately narrows the brief's own B3b scope (dropping the member-count concept entirely)
  rather than attempting a partial/approximate version of it — a fabricated or estimated count would
  violate this spec's own SC-005 ("nothing shown is ever fabricated"), so the honest choice was to show what
  the system actually knows (elapsed time, free-text progress) rather than something that only resembles
  the brief's original mockup.
