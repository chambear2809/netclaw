# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw Mobile 1.0.1 Polish Pass (Phase A + C1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The source material
  (`mobile/netclaw-mobile/NETCLAW-MOBILE-1.0.1-BRIEF.md`) is an unusually
  specific handoff brief — every Evidence claim for the six items in this
  spec's scope was independently re-verified against the current tree (file
  and line) before writing, and every acceptance/gotcha in the brief already
  resolved the kind of ambiguity a [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker exists to
  flag.
- Mentions of specific file/dependency names (`Runner.entitlements`,
  `flutter_markdown`, `share_plus`, `ColorScheme`, `flutter_native_splash`)
  appear only in this spec's Context and Assumptions sections, matching this
  repo's established pattern (see spec 105's own checklist notes for the same
  convention). One Functional Requirement (dark-mode color literals) and one
  User Story's acceptance scenario reference the observable absence of
  hardcoded colors as a directly testable, code-level outcome — deliberately
  concrete because the brief itself frames every acceptance line as "write
  these as test names," and "no hardcoded color literal remains" is the
  literal, verifiable form of that requirement. User Scenarios, the remaining
  Functional Requirements, and Success Criteria otherwise stay
  implementation-agnostic throughout.
- Phase B items (B1–B5) from the same brief are explicitly out of scope,
  recorded in both the Input description and Assumptions — each will become
  its own future numbered spec per the brief's own recommendation.
