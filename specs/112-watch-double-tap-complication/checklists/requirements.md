# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw Mobile Watch Double Tap and Corner Complication (B4+B5)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The one genuine open question this spec depends on —
  whether to bump `WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 11.0 for Double Tap, or gate it with a runtime
  availability check and keep the existing 10.0 floor — was resolved directly from evidence already in the
  brief itself (its own B4 acceptance criterion: "On older watches, nothing changes and nothing breaks")
  rather than left as a marker, matching this repo's established practice (see spec 111's own checklist
  notes for the same convention).
- Mentions of specific files/APIs (`ApprovalsView.swift`, `resolve(_:action:)`,
  `.handGestureShortcut(.primaryAction)`, `WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `.widgetLabel`) appear only in
  Context and Assumptions, matching this repo's established pattern — they exist specifically to record
  verified, code-level evidence (including the discovery that the existing passcode-confirmation gate
  already satisfies the brief's stated safety concern, narrowing this spec's real design question to "which
  single control claims the gesture," not "how do we make the gesture safe") that grounds this spec's
  design. User Scenarios, Functional Requirements, and Success Criteria stay implementation-agnostic
  throughout.
- B4's user-facing risk (an accidental gesture approving a network change) was analyzed directly against
  the existing code before writing FR-001/FR-002 rather than assumed from the brief's prose alone — the
  existing `resolve()` function already gates every approval, gesture-triggered or not, behind a fresh
  passcode prompt, so this spec's real job is scoping the gesture to exactly one control, not building a
  new safety mechanism.
