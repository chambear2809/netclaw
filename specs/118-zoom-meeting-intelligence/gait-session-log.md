# GAIT Session Log — Feature 118 (NetClaw for Zoom — Meeting Intelligence)

Per Constitution Principle IV (Immutable Audit Trail) / `tasks.md` T052. Recorded at implementation
time, mirroring the format used in `specs/035-claroty-mcp/gait-session-log.md`.

## Session summary (2026-08-17)

Full `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.clarify` (avatar scope) → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` →
`/speckit.analyze` (6 findings, all remediated) → `/speckit.implement` pipeline, plus a live Zoom
Marketplace app registration session (real Client ID/Secret, RTMS scopes discovered and corrected
live, DNS record created, ngrok stub server used to unblock Zoom's reachability check).

## Files created

- `mcp-servers/zoom-rtms-mcp/` — new MCP server: `models.py`, `webhook.py`, `rtms_listener.py`,
  `extractor.py`, `recognition.py`, `panel_feed.py`, `zoom_channel_client.py`, `server.py`, `README.md`,
  `requirements.txt`, `__init__.py`, `tests/test_extractor.py`, `tests/test_webhook.py`, `tests/__init__.py`
- `mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp/federation/zoom_channel.py` — Border-side loopback channel
- `mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/tests/test_zoom_channel.py`
- `ui/netclaw-zoom-app/panel.html`, `panel.js`, `overlay.js` (`manifest.json` already existed from the
  live Marketplace setup session, predating this implementation pass)
- `workspace/skills/zoom-meeting-context/SKILL.md`
- `docs/ZOOM-MEETING-INTELLIGENCE.md`
- `specs/118-zoom-meeting-intelligence/` — `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
  `contracts/*.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`, this file

## Files modified

- `mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp-daemon-v2.py` — added `_start_zoom()`, wired into `main()`
- `config/openclaw.json` — `zoom-rtms-mcp` entry
- `scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py` — `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATIONS` gained "Zoom Meetings MCP"
- `.env.example` — new Zoom variables block
- `.gitignore` — negation entry for `mcp-servers/zoom-rtms-mcp/`
- `README.md` — counts (165→167 MCP, 222→223 skills) at lines 7/242/521/677, new bullet in
  "Additional Server Notes", new Skills table row
- `SOUL.md` — counts at lines 15/717, new "Zoom Meeting Intelligence Skills (1)" section
- `TOOLS.md` — new credential-reference line
- `scripts/lib/catalog.sh` — `zoom-rtms` catalog entry (Voice & Social category)
- `scripts/lib/install-steps.sh` — `component_install_zoom_rtms()`
- `ui/netclaw-visual/server.js` — `zoom-rtms` metadata entry (auto-discovered node; this adds the
  descriptive notes/env/files the HUD's live computation shows alongside it)

## Verification performed (real, not assumed)

- `mcp-servers/zoom-rtms-mcp/tests/` — 11/11 pytest pass (extractor classification incl. the
  hypothetical/past-tense/third-party safety boundary; webhook lifecycle incl. SC-006's
  destroy-not-flag behavior)
- `mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/tests/test_zoom_channel.py` — 2/2 pytest pass (mocked `run_agent_turn`;
  confirms the read path completes without any new approval step, and a write-classified utterance
  reaches the agent verbatim with no bypass)
- `python3 scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py` — PASS (223 skills, 167 MCP integrations, all
  documentation locations agree)
- `python3 scripts/verify-catalog-coverage.py` — PASS (zero unexplained gaps)
- `python3 scripts/reconcile-mcp.py` — PASS on all 7 surfaces (catalog, dependencies, docs,
  meraki-ids, packages, portability, **startup** — `zoom-rtms-mcp/server.py` actually launches
  cleanly)
- `node --check ui/netclaw-visual/server.js` — syntax OK
- `bash -n scripts/lib/catalog.sh scripts/lib/install-steps.sh` — syntax OK
- Manual smoke test: `zoom-rtms-mcp`'s webhook (`endpoint.url_validation` handshake) and panel feed
  (WebSocket upgrade) both verified live against a running instance of the server outside the stdio
  gate (a plain `< /dev/null` invocation exits immediately by FastMCP stdio design once stdin EOFs —
  not a bug; verified separately by holding the process open).
- Regression check against pre-existing capabilities: see `tasks.md` T053's own record (this session
  does not duplicate that output here to avoid drift between two copies of the same result).

## Known, documented gaps (not hidden — see `mcp-servers/zoom-rtms-mcp/README.md`'s "Known Environment
Limitations" section for full detail)

- Zoom's official RTMS Python SDK not installed in this environment (defensive import, degrades to
  logged no-op).
- Official Zoom Meetings MCP exact tool/credential shape unconfirmed (research.md R6).
- Layers API Camera-mode access unconfirmed (research.md R8) — User Story 5 implemented per design,
  live verification deferred to the operator.
- `InvestigationRequest.write_action_detected`/`approval_ref` fields exist but have no real signal to
  populate them from yet — documented in detail in `zoom_channel.py`'s `_run_investigation`. The
  underlying device-write approval gate itself is unaffected/unbypassed; this is an audit-visibility
  gap, not a safety gap.
