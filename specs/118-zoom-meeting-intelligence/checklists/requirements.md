# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw for Zoom — Meeting Intelligence (MVP)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All items pass on first draft. The Input field and Assumptions section name specific
  technologies (RTMS, Zoom MCP, Meeting SDK) because they are load-bearing scope boundaries carried
  over verbatim from the user's request, not implementation choices made by this spec — the body
  (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) stays behavior-focused throughout.
- Revised after user feedback (2026-08-17): added User Story 5 (camera-overlay avatar) and FR-017–
  FR-020 to make explicit that a visual avatar persona (side panel + optional Layers API camera
  overlay) is in scope, distinct from the still-excluded independent video-tile participant with its
  own injected audio (FR-016). Re-validated against all checklist items above; still passes.
