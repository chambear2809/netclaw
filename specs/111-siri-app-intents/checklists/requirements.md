# Specification Quality Checklist: NetClaw Mobile Siri / App Intents Integration (B1a)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The one genuine open
  architectural question this spec depends on (headless vs.
  `openAppWhenRun`) was resolved directly with the operator *before*
  writing the spec, per the source brief's own instruction not to let
  it be decided implicitly — recorded in Context and Assumptions
  rather than left as a marker.
- Mentions of specific files/classes (`background_refresh.dart`,
  `EdgeAskClient.ask()`, `ConversationStore.onCompleted`,
  `AppDelegate.swift:67-108`) appear only in Context and Assumptions,
  matching this repo's established pattern (see specs 105/110's own
  checklist notes for the same convention) — they exist specifically
  to record verified, code-level evidence (including one correction
  to an initial assumption, discovered via research before writing)
  that grounds this spec's design. User Scenarios, Functional
  Requirements, and Success Criteria stay implementation-agnostic
  throughout, describing observable behavior (a spoken acknowledgment,
  a notification arriving, a bounded timeout) rather than the Swift/
  Dart mechanics that produce it.
- B1b (Control Center `ControlWidget`) is explicitly out of scope,
  recorded in both Input and Assumptions — it will become its own
  future numbered spec once B1a is proven working, per the source
  brief's own recommendation.
